# PlayWave
## A quick and dirty use of .NET to play a .WAV file from the command line

Writing a .BAT file in Windows that does a bunch of stuff while you're doing
something else important (like watching YouTube), but you want it to tell you
when it's done?

So you tried "echo ^G" and that works, but it's kinda wimpy?  And doesn't even
play when your video is on?

And you're too busy to look up how to play sound files in .NET?

Well, have I got a solution for you!  Two of 'em, in fact.  One solution targets
the old tried-and-true .NET Framework (version 4.7), and the other targets .NET
5, which is the current version of .NET as of this writing.

Mind you, the .NET Framework version will give you a .EXE executable that runs
on its own, while you'll have to copy lots more files to get the .NET 5 version
to work.

And if you want to run this on something besides Windows, sorry, you're out of
luck here - you'll have to keep searching.

No license, no muss, no fuss - it's dead simple code.  Enjoy!
